      On Windows machines, you can simply use the included ODBC support
      and the correct ODBC driver.
     </P
><P
>&#13;      On Unix machines, you can use the Sybase-CT driver
      to access Microsoft SQL Servers because they are (at
      least mostly) protocol-compatible. Sybase has made a 
      <A
HREF="http://www.php.net/extra/ctlib-linux-elf.tar.gz"
TARGET="_top"
>free version of the necessary
      libraries for Linux systems</A
>. For other Unix operating
      systems, you need to contact Sybase for the correct libraries.

      Yes. You already have all the tools you need if you are running
      entirely under Windows 9x/Me, or NT/2000, where you can use
      ODBC and Microsoft's ODBC drivers for Microsoft Access databases.
     </P
><P
>&#13;      If you are running PHP on a Unix box and want to talk to MS Access
      on a Windows box you will need Unix ODBC drivers.
      <A
HREF="http://www.openlinksw.com/"
TARGET="_top"
>OpenLink Software</A
> has Unix-based
      ODBC drivers that can do this. There is a free pilot program where you
      can download an evaluation copy that doesn't expire and prices start at
      $675 for the commercial supported version.
     </P
><P
>&#13;      Another alternative is to use an SQL server that has
      Windows ODBC drivers and use that to store the data, which you can
      then access from Microsoft Access (using ODBC) and PHP (using the
      built in drivers), or to use an intermediary file format that Access
      and PHP both understand, such as flat files or dBase databases.

      Virtuoso (a virtual database engine) for NT, Linux and other unix platforms.

      Most likely what has happened is, PHP 4 was compiled with the '--with-mysql'
      option, without specifying the path to MySQL. This means PHP is using its
      built-in MySQL client library. If your system is running applications,
      such as PHP 3 as a concurrent Apache module, or auth-mysql, that use other
      versions of MySQL clients, then there is a conflict between the two
      differing versions of those clients.
     </P

>&#13;      Recompiling PHP 4, and adding the path to MySQL to the flag,
      '<A
HREF="ref.mysql.html#mysql.configure"

>' 
      usually solves the problem.

      If your MySQL libs are linked against pthreads this will happen. Check
      using ldd. If they are, grab the MySQL tarball and compile from source,
      or recompile from the source rpm and remove the switch in the spec file
      that turns on the threaded client code. Either of these suggestions will
      fix this. Then recompile PHP with the new MySQL libs.

      Why do I get an error that looks something like this: 
      "Warning: 0 is not a MySQL result index in &#60;file&#62; 
      on line &#60;x&#62;" or "Warning: Supplied argument is not 
      a valid MySQL result resource in &#60;file&#62; on line &#60;x&#62;?

      You are trying to use a result identifier that is 0. The 0 indicates
      that your query failed for some reason. You need to check for errors
      after submitting a query and before you attempt to use the returned 
      result identifier.  The proper way to do this is with code similar
      to the following:
      <TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
CELLPADDING="5"
><TR
><TD
><code><font color="#000000">
$result = mysql_query("SELECT * FROM tables_priv");<br />if (!$result) {<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;echo mysql_error();<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exit;<br />}</font>
</code></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
      or
      <TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
CELLPADDING="5"
><TR
><TD
><code><font color="#000000">
$result = mysql_query("SELECT * FROM tables_priv")<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or die("Bad query: ".mysql_error());</font>
